**Hello world**,

This is a repository for a test game that I will update weekly with the goal of learning GDScript and using the Godot engine. The game will be in the bricks-breaking genreâ€”simple but useful for my learning.

If you want to use the code for another purpose, feel free! It is original code, and you can use it without needing to give credit.
